## Goal
The goal is to represent IT infrastructure with an informationcentric view. This means that the focus in representing the infrastructure should be on the data flow and communication between the machines. For that the focus must lie on the communication protocols. Nevertheless, the infrastructure should also have information about ther physical location and interconnects. Eventually, all the infrastructure defined should also be easily translated into an ansible playbook for each machine. In this way, the infrastructure can also be set up very easily. With such an approach, IT infrastructure can be represented for system engineers as well as for network and security engineers.
